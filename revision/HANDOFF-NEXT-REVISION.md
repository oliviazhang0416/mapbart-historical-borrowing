# Handoff after the next LRC-BART revision

Latest follow-up, September 11: the clean paper is now 80 pages and the cumulative tracked paper is 101 pages. Section 2.2 explicitly displays the BART expansion and prior for f on page 5; Section 2.4 explains local ESS and its uncensored log-time reference on page 9. See `05-writing/humanize_logs/f_model_20260911/report.md` locally or `revision/review/f_model_20260911/report.md` in the repository. The author deck is now 46 pages after the ENAR-2022 style rewrite and presentation clarifications. Earlier artifact counts below describe historical checkpoints. The repository and RISW copies include these follow-ups.

September 10, 2026. This is the current restart note. The previous handoff is preserved in `05-writing/critical_revisor_logs/run_20260910_094551/round_0/`. Earlier editing reports and their verdicts remain historical assessments of earlier versions.

## Current state

The next scientific revision is complete, with two independent method/applied agent reviews in each of two rounds, followed by integration of the user's `FULL-PAPER-REVIEW.md`. Each round-2 reviewer marked all five of its prior major comments resolved and requested minor corrections, which were applied. The side review assessed the pre-run 82-page baseline; its nine major findings are reconciled in the current report. These are internal AI assessments, not external peer review or scientific/clinical approval.

Read first:

1. `05-writing/prior_mixture_order.md`, then `05-writing/next_revision_report.md`.
2. `05-writing/side_review_reconciliation.md` and the unchanged `FULL-PAPER-REVIEW.md`.
3. `05-writing/critical_revisor_logs/run_20260910_094551/implementation_impact.md`.
4. Both round ledgers and final sources in that run.

Main text: 7,159 texcount text words including the 227-word abstract; 6,932 excluding it. Separate tables, mathematical-expression counts, headings and captions are excluded.

The latest prior-presentation follow-up is complete: equation (2) gives the explicit leaf mixture, followed by one induced pointwise mixture for f_1. The all-spike and all-slab cases are explained in prose, as is the equivalent variance index tau_{1-z_hl}^2. This replaces the separate prior displays on page 5. Appendix A/B retain the equivalent conditional indexed form. The September 11 slide update now gives the leaf mixture on slide 6, the induced f_1 mixture on slide 7, and the unchanged diagram on slide 8; the deck remains 25 slides. See `05-writing/humanize_logs/slide_mixture_sync_20260911/report.md` locally or `revision/review/slide_mixture_sync_20260911/report.md` in the repo. Read `05-writing/prior_mixture_order.md`; the earlier leaf-prior clarification and scientific reviews remain historical snapshots.

## Scientific decisions to preserve

- The commensurate component centers the RCT control response mean f_1 at the external-control mean f. The zero-centered discrepancy is g=f_1-f. The displayed variance H_g tau_0^2 is conditional on every reached leaf indicator being 1. The leaf slide defines how z selects its variance; slide 7 shows the general pointwise mixture marginalized over z, with the all-spike and all-slab components identified beneath it. The mixture remains conditional on w and both scales.
- ESS is a defined variance-based working precision summary. Only the normal reference prior yields the exact marginal ELIR variance ratio. No predictive-consistency claim is made for the BART mixture.
- A standardized mean can span multiple independently labelled leaves; V_g is the sum of squared target leaf proportions times state-specific variances. Binomial(H_g,w) is restricted to one positive-weight leaf per tree. Existing realized/regional results already use the exact weighted-leaf function.
- Calibration retains the implemented mean partition coefficient before inversion, untruncated scale-law integration, and a truncated fitting prior. The rescaled block-law theorem concerns exact integration and grid selection under explicit assumptions. The ceiling cap and upper-grid fallback are separate code branches. A change in these conventions would require new fits.
- The ceiling includes finite BART regularization. Its external-sample-size equality and covariate-shift reduction are a flat-prior, fixed-one-tree reference, not universal finite-prior claims.
- Population support identification, shared-tree extrapolation and conditional empty-leaf priors are distinct. Only the globally single-arm g process is likelihood-independent everywhere.
- G.6 retains all spike contributions in the constrained optimizer, uses integer slab counts and is a conditional prior-density comparison. It implies neither clinical indicator-switching thresholds nor inability of shared-leaf models to borrow locally.
- CAHB has nonparametric kernel outcome/precision estimates. Its transferred R=200 results and diagnostic definitions retain the documented caveats versus the R=500 primary study.
- Gaussian linear means can remain centered while nonlinear survival-ratio means move under discrepancy uncertainty. The application w=0.9 PFS mean changes from 0.97 to 1.00. Empirical near-zero simulation bias is not called theoretical unbiasedness.
- The application adjusts for five baseline covariates plus ASCT after induction. It is a descriptive model-based association conditional on recorded profiles, not a total causal treatment effect. Equal control residual variances are an explicit assumption for counterfactual survival prediction as well as calibration. Changing the adjustment set or variance assumption requires application reanalysis.

## Preserved results and open boundaries

All 304,665 protected files in 01-code, 02-validation and 04-application were verified unchanged. Numerical table/figure files and the diagram were preserved. No simulation or application results were rerun. Bounded deterministic checks exercise the actual C++ weighted variance and revised mathematics; they do not certify the full sampler or operating characteristics.

The unused exported `lrc_ess_prior` helper still uses the tree-binomial approximation; old roxygen summaries are documentation debt. It is not used to produce the reported results. See implementation_impact.md before changing code or interpreting this helper as corrected.

The original MAP-AFT-BART sampler remains unavailable, so earlier tail differences cannot be assigned to a particular prior, coding or sampler change. Clinical qualification, full-model convergence and confirmatory operating-characteristic work remain outside this revision. The user explicitly requested that author names, order and affiliations remain blank for now. This is intentional and is not a pending clarification. Do not infer author metadata from slide credits or ask again unless the user reopens authorship.

Dense simulation tables, their continuation/regional panel and float whitespace remain optional presentation work. Hyperlink borders were hidden. No rows/figures were dropped or redesigned during this round.

## Build and artifact lineage

From 05-writing:

```sh
latexmk -pdf -recorder -outdir=build -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main_draft.tex
latexmk -pdf -recorder -outdir=build -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main_tracked.tex
cp build/main_tracked.pdf main_tracked.pdf
```

Compile `main_lrcbart.tex` in the deck folder with latexmk -pdf. Current clean/redline builds have no LaTeX warnings, unresolved references/citations or overfull boxes. Slides retain Metropolis/font substitution warnings, with no overfull boxes or unresolved references. The preceding scientific run contains complete overview inspection; the latest prior-mixture-order follow-up contains final clean/tracked overviews and targeted page inspections in its visual_qa.md.

The cumulative redline compares the original pre-Codex baseline in `05-writing/humanize_logs/codex_20260910/` with the current paper. `run_20260910_094551/build_tracked.py` expands text/theory inputs using table placeholders, runs latexdiff with whole-math markup, and restores full red-before/blue-after main Tables 1–2 plus blue new cumulative appendix tables. Old captions retain black text with Before revision labels. Bibliography and typography are current and untracked. Round-specific redlines and clean checkpoints are archived separately. Never overwrite immutable baselines.

## Repository and retained authorization

The revision root is not Git. Work from `../yunxuan-repo`, branch `revision/lrc-bart-20260910`, fork remote `koaeraser/mapbart-historical-borrowing`, upstream `oliviazhang0416/mapbart-historical-borrowing`. Existing PR: https://github.com/oliviazhang0416/mapbart-historical-borrowing/pull/1 . Recheck live state before asserting head/review status.

The user previously authorized upload and asking Yunxuan to review. Continue syncing the corrected manuscript/slides and curated review record, committing and pushing the same fork branch without asking again. Preserve the portable LRC_REVISION_ROOT edits in distribution R scripts. Do not copy local caches, compiled libraries, patient data or the large protected-file manifest into Git. Do not send a separate note to Yunxuan; note_to_yunxuan.md remains untouched. Formal reviewer assignment previously failed because the authenticated account lacks upstream permission.

## September 11 presentation prose pass and discussant decks

The 25-slide author presentation has been humanized with the humanize-prose slide workflow. Mathematical expressions, numbers, tables, citations, figures, order and slide count are unchanged. The prior mixture remains on slides 6–7. The live deck keeps its original JSM credits. The source diff and hard-integrity report are in the live deck's `humanize_logs/voice_20260911/` and the repository's `revision/review/slides_voice_20260911/`.

Two new editable PowerPoint discussant decks, industry and hypothetical FDA perspective, each have six core slides for 5–7 minutes plus two backup slides. Final local files are in `06-discussant-decks/output/`; repository copies are under `revision/06-slides/discussants/`. FDA draft guidance is explicitly distinguished from final guidance. The user requested a copy of the main paper and all three presentations in `presentation/invited/RISW-2026/`.
